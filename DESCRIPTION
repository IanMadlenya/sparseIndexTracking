Package: sparseIndexTracking
Title: Design of Portfolio of Stocks to Tracks an Index
Version: 0.1.0
Description: [Benidis, write the description. I already updated the ref and everything else] 
    Computation of sparse eigenvectors of a matrix (aka sparse PCA)
    with running time 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than existing methods and
    better final performance in terms of recovery of sparsity pattern and 
    estimation of numerical values. Can handle covariance matrices as well as 
    data matrices with real or complex-valued entries. Different levels of 
    sparsity can be specified for each individual ordered eigenvector and the 
    method is robust in parameter selection. See vignette for a detailed 
    documentation and comparison, with several illustrative examples. 
    The package is based on the paper:
    K. Benidis, Y. Feng, and D. P. Palomar, “Sparse Portfolios for High-Dimensional 
    Financial Index Tracking,” IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing, vol. 66, no. 1,
